<p>Your last action has triggered the generation of an email.</p>
<p><b><?php echo (isset($Message)?$Message:'');?></b></p>
<p>The next step in this process will be for someone to responding to this email. 
    So please check your mailbox, for either this email, or a reply from someone else. </p>
<p>PLEASE NOTE: The system does not yet send you an email after all the actions of other members, 
    so you will need to return to this web-site to check for updates and progress.</p>
