<H4>Coming Events</h4>
<p>An 'event', is any activity, meeting, invitation offered to international students. 
   This may include meals, day trips, local walks, parties or other activities that 
   a host would like to invite international students to attend.</p>
   <p>Many of these events will only only be accessible to students who have registered 
      and will be by invitation only.</p> 
<p>On this page, there is a list of the events that our hosts are currently making public.  
   To be able to attend any of these events, you may still need to register as a guest, 
but the host wants to open the event to guests to be able to invite themselves. </p>
