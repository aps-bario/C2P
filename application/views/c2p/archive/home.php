<H4>ONE WAY - Helping to connect Chinese Christians going home</h4>
<p>C2P is a new secure Internet service intended to help Chinese students, 
who have found faith while studying overseas, connect with like minded brothers 
and sisters for fellowship, when they return home.</p>
<p><i style="color:#FF0000;">This website does not hold any information about people 
in China or even those returning to China. </i> </p>
<p>This service simply links people who have friends returning home, with those who already 
have friends in China. </p>
    <p>If you are currently in China, or will be soon be returning there, then we do not want to 
hold your information.  
Please find a friend, who does not reside in that country and who is 
willing to act as your 'sponsor'.  
This person should then register <a href="../oneway/newmember">here</a> in order to make 
contact enquiries on your behalf. </p>
<p>If you are Chinese and would like to help connect others returning home, 
then you also will need a friend to be your representative outside China. 
Once we have verified their identity, they will take sole responsibility for deciding whether 
or not to pass on to you details of anyone returning to your home town.</p>
<h3>IMPORTANT NOTICE</h3>
<p>This web-site is currently under development and is still being tested. You are 
 	welcome to register as a student sponsor and participate in the testing, your feedback
	would be very much appreciated. Please be advised that while this system is being 
	developed, this service may not be the fastest or most efficient way of connecting 
	students returning to China, also any emails you receive are likely 
   	to be test items and should be treated as such until the site is launched. </p>
