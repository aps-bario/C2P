<h4>Contacts (Gate Keepers)</h4>
<p>If you are someone who has contacts in various different locations in China, and you know 
that those people, that you know personally, are willing to assist others returning home to find 
fellowship in these places, then you could be a useful contact for help others who know students 
returning to China. </p>
<p>For reasons of security we <b>do not</b> want to know the details of people you know, 
but would rather simply have your details on file, so that we can refer to you those who are looking 
for assistance connecting contacts.</p>
<p>As this online service will have information about your contacts, you will be solely responsible 
for deciding which returnees to refer to your contacts.  You will from time to time receive emails 
from those looking looking for assistance, it will be your decision if you are able and willing to assist
in any given case. All we ask is that you follow through of requests that you accept, or let the system 
know if you are unable to help for whatever reason, so that another contact may be sort.</p>
