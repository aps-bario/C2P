<p>

          Underlying coding framework updated from version 2.1.2 (2016)

          encounter any errors or issues.</li>
       <li>
          A membership structure, based on identity of references, now makes it 
          possible to prioritise referrals to contacts 'closer to' related members
          in the wider network. [This may need some further work, as not all members 
          received initial references from their own organisation.]</li>
      <li>
          Menu headings have changed so that 'Member' has become 'My Account' 
          and 'Sponsor' has become 'Returnees' so that the basic menu 
          headings are more intuitive to new users. </li>   
      <!--<li>
          New style sheet and menu system to provide now space on web pages</li>

      <li>
          A new <b>Security Warning</b> page has been added. [Please feel free to suggest additions / changes.]</li>
      <li>
