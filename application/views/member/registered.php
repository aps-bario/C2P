<H4>Welcome back <?=$FirstName;?> - your member status is currently: <b><?=$Status;?></b></h4>
<p>
    Thank you registering as a member of the C2P network. 
    Before we can able to process the membership any further, 
    it is important to verify that the email address you provided is both correct, 
    and that you are able to access email messages sent to it.</p>
<p>
    You have been sent an email, to the address you provided,  
    and that email included a link back to this web-site. 
    However, you do not appear to have responded to that email. 
    Please check your email account, including any SPAM or JUNK folders. </p>
<p>
    Once your email address has been verified, 
    you will next be required to provide details of a reference. This is important, 
    because other members of the network need to be confident that you are, 
    who you say that you are, that you are actually helping returnees, 
    and that someone else confirms your suitability to be a member. </P>
<p>
    Please review the security guidelines [To be Added].</P>
