<H4>Dear <?=$FirstName;?>,- your member status is currently: <b><?=$Status;?></b></h4>
<p>A status of 'Concerns' means that someone else in the network has expressed 
      concerns about your membership of this network. </p>
<p>This might be in 
   relation to a conversation you, or one of your contacts, have had, or because
   they are unsure of your identity.</p>
<p>Your access has therefore been temporarily 
   revoked, pending an investigation of these concerns.</P>
<p>If you are unaware of these concerns being raised, please contact the system
   administrators, using <a href="../c2p/feedback">feedback</a>.</p>
