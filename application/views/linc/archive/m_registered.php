<H4>Welcome back <?=$FirstName;?></h4>
<h4>Current member status: <b><?=$Status;?></b></h4>
<p>This means that you have entered your basic contact details, 
    but you have not yet responded to the email that you were sent
    in order to confirm your email address.</p>
<p>You will also need to provide details of a Referee who can confirm
    your identify - you should now see a menu option 
    <a href='/mobile/newreferee'>New Referee</a>.</p>
<p>Once your email address has been verified, and your referee has confirmed
    they are happy for you to use this system, your status will automatically 
    be upgraded to <b>Member</b> and you will be able to request referrals 
    for returnees you know.</p>
