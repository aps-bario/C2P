<h5>A Returnee Referral Network</h5>
<p>LINC Ministries have partnered with Connecting2People to help students who have found 
    faith while studying overseas, to connect to people who share their Christian 
    faith back home. It may also be used to help in a similar way while they move 
    from place to place, while overseas.</p>
<p>The Internet is not a secure place to store personal information, especially 
    about people in, or returning to, countries where people are often 
    persecuted for their beliefs, so <i style="color:red;">this web site does not hold 
    any information about people in, or returning to, such countries</i>. It is 
    simply a semi-automated referral system that allows people who have friends 
    returning home to network with other people who already have friends in such
    countries. </p>
<h4>Are you a Returnee?</h4>
<p>If you have been working or studying overseas, have become a Christian, and 
    will be returning home in the near future, then we would like to help you 
    to connect back home with people who share your faith. 
    For security reasons we do not want to have your contact details
    in our system, and therefore in order to assist you, you will need to  
    a friend who lives outside your home country, to act as your sponsor and point 
    of contact. You will then need to ask that friend to 
    <a href="../linc/newmember">register here</a> 
    as a member of this system, in order to as your 
    <a href="../linc/sponsor">Sponsor</a>
    in order to make enquiries on your behalf.</p>
